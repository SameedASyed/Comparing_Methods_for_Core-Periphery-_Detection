# Comparing_Methods_for_Core-Periphery-_Detection
In this project I try to discern the efficacy of centrality measures in detecting the core and preiphery of networks. I also compare the efficacy of centrality measures with that of BE_Algorithm as is available in the cpnet library. Finally, I detect core-periphery structure in empirical networks.
